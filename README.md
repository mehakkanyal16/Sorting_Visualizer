# 🎨 Sorting Visualizer 🚀  
A web-based tool to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work, making learning and understanding sorting techniques easier and more interactive! 📊✨  

---

## 📌 Implemented Sorting Algorithms 🔢  
This visualizer supports the following sorting algorithms:  

✅ **Bubble Sort** – Simple but inefficient 🫧  
✅ **Selection Sort** – Repeatedly finds the minimum value 🎯  
✅ **Insertion Sort** – Efficient for small datasets ✏️  
✅ **Merge Sort** – Divide and conquer approach 🔀  
✅ **Quick Sort** – Fastest sorting algorithm (on average) ⚡  
✅ **Heap Sort** – Efficient tree-based sorting 🌳  

Each algorithm is displayed step-by-step, helping you **visualize the sorting process** dynamically!

## 🎨 Visual Representation of Sorting Steps  
Colors are used to differentiate the **current state** of elements:  

🔵 **Blue** – Default state (Unsorted)  
🟡 **Yellow** – Elements being compared  
🔴 **Red** – Incorrect position (To be moved)  
🟢 **Green** – Correct position (Sorted)  

This **color-coded visualization** enhances your understanding of how sorting works behind the scenes.

## ⚙️ Interactive Features & Controls  
🚀 **Speed Control** – Adjust the speed of the sorting animation (5 levels).  
📊 **Data Size Control** – Modify the number of elements in the array.  
🔀 **Random Data Generation** – Shuffle and generate new data instantly.  
🎭 **Algorithm Selection** – Switch between different sorting algorithms dynamically.  

This tool allows you to **experiment with different sorting methods**, compare their performance, and understand how each algorithm operates.

## 📈 Complexity Analysis  
Each sorting algorithm has different **Time & Space Complexity** based on worst, average, and best cases. This visualizer provides real-time insights into:  

### ⏳ Time Complexity (Big-O Notation)  
- 🟥 **Worst Case**: `O(n²)` or `O(n log n)`  
- 🟨 **Average Case**: `O(n²)` or `O(n log n)`  
- 🟩 **Best Case**: `O(n)` or `O(n log n)`  

### 💾 Space Complexity  
- Some algorithms require **extra memory** (Merge Sort).  
- Others work **in-place** with constant memory (Quick Sort, Heap Sort).

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
🔹 **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Core web technologies for UI & animations.  
🔹 **Vanilla JS & DOM Manipulation** – For real-time sorting visualization.  
🔹 **CSS Animations** – To create smooth and engaging sorting effects.  

This project is a great **learning tool for beginners** in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and helps develop a strong foundation in sorting techniques.
